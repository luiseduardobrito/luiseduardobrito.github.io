## Project Dependencies

This project was created in NodeJS, based on the Github's Electron that powers the great Atom editor. This platform allows the developer to create a single *sort-of-web-based* project (HTML, CSS and JS), but with direct access to the NPM packages running natively using Chromium's V8 and WebKit.
